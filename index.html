      About me: not a very social person; refuses to talk to
      teachers. Also only knows how to python (bad).
      This is my first site, done with nothing special, just html, css, javascript. Almost 100% learnt from AI as well,
      which is cool ig.

      "Who’s joe?" a distant voice asks.

      Instantly everyone nearby hears the sound of 1,000s of bricks rapidly shuffling towards his location.

      The earth itself seemed to cry out in agony, until finally the ground itself split open and a horrific
      creature
      crawled from the ground, covered in mucus and tar.

      ”Joe Momma…” the creature whispered.

      The man cried out in pain as he disintegrated into dust, and the whole world fell silent in fear.

      "I did a little trolling." the wretched creature remarked before burrowing back into the earth.

      Why is six afraid of seven?

      Six hasn't been the same since he left Vietnam. He can seldom close his eyes without opening them again at
      fear
      of Charlies lurking in the jungle trees. Not that you could ever see the bastards, mind you. They were swift,
      and they knew their way around the jungle like nothing else. He remembers the looks on the boys' faces as he
      walked into that village and... oh, Jesus. The memories seldom left him, either. Sometimes he'd reminisce -
      even
      hear - Tex's southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cigarettes like nothing else. He always kept
      a
      pack of Lucky's with him. The boys are gone, now. He knows that; it's just that he forgets, sometimes. And,
      every now and then, the way that seven looks at him with avid concern in his eyes... it makes him think. Sets
      him on edge. Makes him feel like he's back there... in the jungle.
