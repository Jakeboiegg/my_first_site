      About me: not a very social person; refuses to talk to
      teachers. Also only knows how to python (bad).
      This is my first site, done with nothing special, just html, css, javascript. Almost 100% learnt from AI as well,
      which is cool ig.

      <h2>History should not be a school subject</h2>
      <p>27 April 2024</p>

      <p>
        History is all about looking back to the past, learning from the past and apply what is learnt to the current,
        present world.
        <br><br>
        However, the world is developing at such a pace that the world in the past is vastly different from what we are
        now. In History, students study wars, two different factions sending thousands of men into the battle fields.
        But
        with the invention of nuclear bombs, there is now rarely any physical sword clashing, but cold wars where both
        parties try to out-scare their opponents with more powerful bombs. The world is changing rapidly, and straying
        further and further away from the past.
        <br><br>
        History is also taking time away from studying other subjects, like languages, Mathematics, and the sciences.
        Instead of learning about rules and policies in the past that change over time, we can instead learn about
        timeless, universal laws like Newton's 3 laws of mation. History, while not completely useless, is taking time
        away from learning knowlegde that can be more easily applied to our lives, and therefore should be removed.
